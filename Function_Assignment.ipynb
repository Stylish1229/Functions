For example, in `def add(a, b):`, `a` and `b` are parameters. When calling `add(2, 3)`, `2` and `3` are arguments. Arguments can be positional (matched by order) or keyword (matched by name). Python also supports default parameter values, variable-length arguments (`*args` for positional, `**kwargs` for keyword), allowing flexibility in function calls. Parameters define the function's interface, while arguments provide the data."

        "8.  What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "- A **lambda function** in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with `def`, lambda functions are concise and typically used for short, simple operations. They can take any number of arguments but must consist of a single expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Syntax**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Features**\n",
        "1. **Anonymous**: Lambda functions do not have a name (unless assigned to a variable).\n",
        "2. **Single Expression**: They can only contain one expression, which is evaluated and returned.\n",
        "3. **Inline Use**: Often used inline where a function is required temporarily.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **When to Use Lambda Functions**\n",
        "1. **Short, One-Time Operations**:\n",
        "   - Ideal for simple tasks that don't require a full function definition.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "   print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **As Arguments to Higher-Order Functions**:\n",
        "   - Commonly used with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Using with map()\n",
        "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "   squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
        "   print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Using with filter()\n",
        "   evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
        "   print(list(evens))  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Using with sorted()\n",
        "   points = [(1, 2), (4, 1), (3, 3)]\n",
        "   sorted_points = sorted(points, key=lambda x: x[1])\n",
        "   print(sorted_points)  # Output: [(4, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inline Function Definitions**:\n",
        "   - Useful when a function is needed temporarily and defining a full function would be cumbersome.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Inline usage\n",
        "   result = (lambda x, y: x * y)(3, 4)\n",
        "   print(result)  # Output: 12\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Simplifying Code**:\n",
        "   - Reduces boilerplate code for simple operations.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Without lambda\n",
        "   def add(x, y):\n",
        "       return x + y\n",
        "\n",
        "   # With lambda\n",
        "   add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Limitations**\n",
        "- Lambda functions are limited to a single expression and cannot include statements like `if`, `for`, or `while`.\n",
        "- For more complex logic, a regular function (`def`) is preferred.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example Use Case**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Sorting a list of tuples by the second element\n",
        "data = [(1, 3), (4, 1), (2, 2)]\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, **lambda functions** are best used for short, simple operations, especially when passing a function as an argument to higher-order functions or when a temporary function is needed. For more complex tasks, regular functions are more appropriate."

        "9.  Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "- The `map()` function in Python is used to apply a given function to all items in an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and return an iterator that yields the results. It is a built-in function that simplifies the process of transforming data without explicitly writing loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Purpose**\n",
        "- **Apply a Function to Multiple Items**: `map()` allows you to apply a function to every element of an iterable efficiently.\n",
        "- **Functional Programming**: It supports a functional programming style, enabling concise and readable code for data transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Syntax**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
        "```\n",
        "- `function`: The function to apply to each item in the iterable.\n",
        "- `iterable`: The iterable (e.g., list, tuple) whose items will be processed.\n",
        "- Additional iterables can be provided if the function takes multiple arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Usage**\n",
        "1. **Basic Example**:\n",
        "   - Apply a function to each element in a list.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "   squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
        "   print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Using a Named Function**:\n",
        "   - You can use a predefined function instead of a lambda.\n",

        "   def square(x):\n",
        "       return x ** 2\n",

        "   print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Multiple Iterables**:\n",
        "   - If the function takes multiple arguments, provide multiple iterables.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   numbers1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   numbers2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
        "   result = map(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers1, numbers2)\n",
        "   print(list(result))  # Output: [5, 7, 9]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Type Conversion**:\n",
        "   - Convert a list of strings to integers.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   str_numbers = [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]\n",
        "   int_numbers = map(int, str_numbers)\n",
        "   print(list(int_numbers))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Points**\n",
        "- **Lazy Evaluation**: `map()` returns an iterator, so it doesn't compute the results until you iterate over it (e.g., using `list()`).\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: It avoids the need for explicit loops, making the code more concise and often more readable.\n",
        "- **Functional Style**: Encourages a functional programming approach, where functions are applied to data without side effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example Use Case**\n",

        "1. **List of Book Orders**:\n",
        "   - Each tuple in the list contains:\n",
        "     - Order number.\n",
        "     - Quantity of books.\n",
        "     - Price per item.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`calculate_total` Function**:\n",
        "   - Takes an order tuple as input.\n",
        "   - Calculates the total cost as `quantity * price_per_item`.\n",
        "   - Adds €10 if the total cost is less than €100.\n",
        "   - Returns a tuple with the order number and the adjusted total cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`map()` Function**:\n",
        "   - Applies the `calculate_total` function to each order in the list using a lambda function.\n",
        "   - Returns a `map` object.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Convert to List**:\n",
        "   - The `map` object is converted to a list for easy display.\n",
